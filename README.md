## 🔍 Overview
**CjLua** is an open-source Lua scripting library founded by **Faheem**.  
Its mission is to simplify Lua scripting while providing developers with a modular, reliable,  
and well-documented set of tools to build on top of.  

Lua is powerful but often scattered across different tutorials or outdated code samples.  
CjLua aims to fix that by serving as a **central hub for modern Lua scripts and modules** — ready for prototyping, experimentation, and integration.
